# Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules

This website will make it easier to fill out the public consultation form and gives helpful guidance. It allows to download a finished ODT document to send to the commission.

Work in Progress...

## How to help

Add questions to `_data/questions.yml`. The format should be more or less self-explanatory. The odf keys come from the data/content.xml file and identify the appropriate XML entity by name.

## Provide answers for review

If you want to provide your own perspective, it's a matter of filling in a spreadsheet with answers for each question. [You can take this spreadsheet as an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhDkodM9ozpddFkxZE95VHJpczV4dks3bTJ5NzhNRmc&usp=sharing
).

- The "Question" column contains the question number
- The "Option" column may contain a number (1, 2 or 3) if there is an option to fill in (choosing the first, second or third option)
- The "Answer" column may contain text that will be filled in if there is text field related to the chosen option or if it's an open question
- The "Explanation" column may contain an explanation to the question or the given answer that will be shown along-side it.
